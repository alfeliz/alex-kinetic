# alex-kinetic
Octave script to be able to obtian kinetic and total eenergy on an exploding wire and compare both energies.

## Working

This script takes electrical signals and convert them into electrical energy.
Also from the streak images obtains the radial expansion and transform it into kinetec energy and total internal energy, 
in order to compare them.


## Necessary files

Out of __alex_kinetic.m__, the files *chan.m, supsmu.m, baseline.m, ratio.m, deri.m,* and *poladj.m* are used.
